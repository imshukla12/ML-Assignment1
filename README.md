# ML-Assignment1

In this project, I have built predictive models for two datasets: one for predicting Titanic passenger survival using classification techniques, and the other for predicting diamond prices using regression methods. I implemented various algorithms, performed data preprocessing, explored feature selection, and evaluated the models using F1 Score and Mean Squared Error metrics. All implementations were done without using external libraries like Scikit-Learn.
